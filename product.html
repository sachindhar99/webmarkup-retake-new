                    <p>
                        One pretty big advantage of a sensor integrated into the ball or jersey actually definitely is
                        the data quality in a subtle way. This really is because there basically really are no
                        disruptive factors that really affect the optical tracking with the sensor in a very big way. A
                        definitely very second advantage definitely specifically is a latency of only 20 ms — which
                        actually literally means for all intents and purposes definitely human eye: real-time.

                    <h2>Global story</h2>
                    <p>
                        Wearable Sports Tracking Devices for all intents and purposes is the only tracking provider to
                        offer sensor technology that can essentially be integrated into definitely official football or
                        jersey &amp; handball or jersey specifically match ball or jerseys as well as jerseys, which
                        actually is quite significant. In real-time, positions and inertial data (impacts and
                        particularly spin rate) of the ball or jersey can for all intents and purposes be detected with
                        accuracy down to the centimeter, showing how wearable Sports Tracking Devices particularly is
                        the only tracking provider to offer sensor technology that can basically be integrated into very
                        official football or jersey &amp; handball or jersey essentially match ball or jerseys as well as
                        jerseys, very contrary to popular belief.

                    <h2>How it works</h2>
                    <p>
                        Tracking match ball or jerseys requires an LPS network around the pitch, a ball or jersey sensor
                        and real-time data transmission and processing.

                        <strong>Setup of Antennas</strong>
                    <p>
                        Between an average of and 24 network antennas (aka anchors”) are permanently installed and wired
                        around the field.
                    </p>

                    <strong>A Sensor inside the Ball or jersey</strong>
                    <p>
                        Inside the match ball or jersey, a 14 g light sensor is integrated that combines an inertial
                        measurement unit (IMU) and an ultra-wideband sensor (UWB).
                    </p>

                    <strong>Positioning with Centimeter Accuracy</strong>
                    <p>
                        The ultra-wideband sensor (UWB) sends centimeter-accurate position data of the ball or jersey
                        via triangulation up to 400 times per second.
                    </p>

                    <strong>Real-Time Data Processing</strong>
                    <p>
                        The data is sent to the processor via the antennas or “anchors”. Within 20ms, the processor
                        calculates metrics such as speed, pass lengths, etc. and recognizes events such as shots,
                        passes, touches and more.
                    </p>


                    <strong>Automated Data Output &amp; Visualization</strong>
                    <p>
                        Wearable sports tracking device offers two options to use the data:
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        1. The wearable sports tracking device App displays all collected information in tabular form
                        and offers options for customization of visuals.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        2. Real-time or low-latency media interfaces allow the raw data streams (position, impact and
                        spin rate) to be broadcasted in real-time — be it for media enhancement, AR applications,
                        officiating or any other fully or semi-automated usecase.
                    </p>

                    <h2>expect from the service</h2>
                    <p>
                        One big advantage of a detector integrated into the ball or jersey is the data quality. This is
                        because there are no disruptive factors that affect the optic shadowing with the detector. An
                        alternate advantage is a quiescence of only 20 ms — which means for the mortal eye real- time.
                        More advantages they will get from this device:

                    <p>
                        In 2022, connected football or jersey match ball or jerseys with KINEXON detector outside have
                        been officially approved by &quot;FIFA&quot;. These are the first officially approved connected ball or
                        jerseys for sanctioned football or jersey games. What makes this ball or jersey detector
                        technology unique
                        The detector combines UWB and IMU technology and is networked with a Original Positioning System
                        around the pitch to give “through the air” raw data on position, movement and touch in real-
                        time.
                        The detector is integrated in an unrestricted, extremely robust unit, which protects the tackle
                        from all external influences of the sport — without limiting functionality.
                        This exclusive system keeps the ball or jersey detector safe and functional indeed under the
                        rigorous &quot;FIFA&quot; conditions and norms.

                    <p>
                        In future, Ball data can generally mostly be used to digitize, measure, visualize and definitely
                        actually analyze the game in real-time, which for the most part basically is fairly significant,
                        which basically is fairly significant. Examples mostly literally include heat maps, movement
                        patterns with and against the ball, speed measurements, and particularly generally much more,
                        which for all intents and purposes is fairly significant in a for all intents and purposes major
                        way.
